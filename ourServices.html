			<h2>CEDAR WOOD FENCING</h2>
			<p>A lot of fencing contractors will give you a 'good deal' on your fence, however they may sacrifice the quality of your fence in doing so. In order to ensure that our fence installation service exceeds your expectations, we will only recommend materials and a fence design that are in your best interest. When it comes to wood fencing and fence design, you can’t go wrong with cedar wood. Any fencing pro can tell you cedar is popular for its resistance to insects, decay and shrinkage, you can bet that you will reap the quality for years to come! We like cedar wood because it’s resistant to cracking, warping, twisting, and splitting. It’s also easy to paint or stain to match any setting! We recommend a weather-proof coating (red or yellow tint) to seal the quality of the wood. 

			About our cedar wood fencing quality:

			When we go to purchase the material for you fence, we hand pick each picket to make sure that every piece is up to par. 
			We also ways use coated, rust proof screws when building wood fences. Some may choose to use nails but we don’t recommend doing this.
			No short cuts, no exceptions. 
			You can expect a fair competitive price for a quality job you’ll love.

			<h2>WROUGHT IRON FENCING</h2>
			<p>Our wrought iron fences aren&#39;t just built. The materials are hand picked and held to a quality standard. Each piece is measured and cut to precision. The fences are not just welded together, they&#39;re perfectly placed and welded not only for durability, but also to be visually pleasing. Our wrought iron fences are given a primer coat for protection and a final shiny black coat to be as beautiful as they are strong. And when they are installed, they&#39;re accountable to stand strong and made to last a lifetime. 

			Whether you&#39;re looking for a gate to compliment your driveway, or if you&#39;re needing to secure your property, Bardo&#39;s your one-stop fence installation service. We can create a classic, traditional gate or a modernized one of your choice. If you&#39;re seeking a quick team full of integrity and creativity to build your steel gate or fence, you&#39;re in the right place.

			<h2>STEEL ART</h2>
			<p>As a professional welder, you could imagine Bardo enjoys welding in his spare time. We receive various steel art requests from friends and clients. If it involves steel art, welding, imagination and creativity, chances are, Bardo can do it. It&#39;s worth stating that we won&#39;t take on a steel art project we know we won&#39;t be able to perfect. However, Bardo welcomes any challenge and it&#39;s also worth noting clients are always satisfied with the end product. From steel tables, to AC unit cages, to company logos, and minions, Bardo genuinely enjoys bringing steel ideas to life.

			<h2>CEDAR WOOD FENCING</h2>
			<p>A lot of fencing contractors will give you a 'good deal' on your fence, however they may sacrifice the quality of your fence in doing so. In order to ensure that our fence installation service exceeds your expectations, we will only recommend materials and a fence design that are in your best interest. When it comes to wood fencing and fence design, you can&#39;t go wrong with cedar wood. Any fencing pro can tell you cedar is popular for its resistance to insects, decay and shrinkage, you can bet that you will reap the quality for years to come! We like cedar wood because it&#39;s resistant to cracking, warping, twisting, and splitting. It&#39;s also easy to paint or stain to match any setting! We recommend a weather-proof coating (red or yellow tint) to seal the quality of the wood.

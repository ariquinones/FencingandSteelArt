			<h1>About Us</h1>
			<p> After 35 years of being a professional welder / supervisor, Bardo set out to put his skills to the test. Starting out in 2014, we reached out to family members and friends to see if they needed any fencing or steel work, landed a few gigs and to this day, all clients have heard of Bardo's Fencing & Steel Art by referral or because they asked about a fence they saw around Houston. 

			We build fencing of all kinds - wood, wrought iron, chain link, you name it. We also handle repairs if a fence is repairable. If you are needing to remove an old fence and build a new one, we also take care of tearing down old fencing to build new ones. 

			Non-fencing projects consist of wood patio decks, steel tables, steel AC unit cages, logo designs and more!

			Two year ago, we never imagined having the opportunity to help so many Houstonians. It's truly a blessing to do what you love and to have the ability to help others. That's what makes this journey worth it!

			<h2>About Bardo:</h2>

			He loves fresh weather, friendly dogs, working outdoors... And he's kind of obsessed with Coca-Cola. In his spare time away from welding, you can find him at an antique shop or lost in his Coca-Cola room. Check it out.

			We are a family owned and operating small local business.
